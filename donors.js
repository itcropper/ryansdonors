I remember going on exchanges with him one time in Korea.. we were both Jr companions (something that they shortly after did away with-- 2 jr companions together on exchanges).  Neither of us could hardly speak Korean at the time.  Even though he had only been in Korea for under 3 transfers, he taught me a ton, yet he kept telling me how I was awesome and such a great missionary, etc.  It was clear to me that he had a great deal of humility and I feel eternally grateful for him and the things that I&#039;ve tried to learn and emulate from his example.  I&#039;m so sorry for your loss.

His hard work, encouragement of his peers, humility, and sense of humor, among so many genuine and endearing qualities, made a huge impression on me. We worked together in small groups and on clinical rotations. Ryan frequently was the example of excellence in those contexts and served as the ready volunteer for difficult tasks. There was rarely an interaction that we had where I wasn&#039;t left motivated or inspired to keep trying, to meet his standard. I can only imagine how devastating a loss this is for his loved ones. It was so apparent how deeply he cared for his family. I&#039;ll never forget the following sweet examples of his love: I recall that each day he would use his scarce, short lunch breaks to call his wife to check in on his young family. Perhaps most touching and bittersweet now, is the memory of when he showed me a picture of a beautiful necklace. He explained how he planned to buy the necklace for his wife one day after residency when he could afford it. While the rest of us in the group were sitting around chatting, he was dreaming of their future together.","address":"San Antonio, TX 78249, USA"},null,{"geo":{"lat":45.4807521,"lng":-122.6427372},"amt":25,"isAnonymous":false,"name":"Rachel Bullen Sdrulla","comment":"So very sorry for your loss.

My heart is shattered for the Folsom and Thomson family, especially for Lauren and her dearest children.  I was Ryan&#039;s classmate in medical school and everyone in my class would agree that Ryan was the nicest and and most genuine guy we had in our class. We were lucky to have spent almost 4 years with him. This medical school process and residency interviewing season is grueling and physically and emotionally taxing. I just had my last interview yesterday and I can&#039;t help think that Ryan was probably at the tail end of his interview season too.  From comments that I read on various outlets, it seems that this woman who hit Ryan head-on was not an honest accident, but instead was premeditated and intentional. Comments and reports state that she intentionally crossed the median, called her mother and said she was upset and let her mother know what she was about to do. It is truly unfortunate that she was the one who walked away alive with minor injuries. If this all holds to be true, I want to encourage the Folsom and Thomson family to file a civil lawsuit against this woman for wrongful death, negligence, and battery. Lauren and her family should be fully compensated by the auto insurance company, the woman, and potentially this woman&#039;s family as well. This woman should rightfully be charged with first degree murder and Lauren and her kids deserve full compensation and expenses paid for lost wages and more. I know nothing will ever replace Ryan but I hope this money will be of service to Lauren and her children and I hope that justice is served for Ryan and his family.  My prayer for the Folsom and Thomson family comes from Psalm 147:3 &quot;He heals the brokenhearted and binds up their wounds.'  Praying for Lauren, her children, Folsom and Thomson family during this time of heartache.","address":"San Antonio, TX 78240, USA"},{"geo":{"lat":40.6712875,"lng":-111.7912764},"amt":50,"isAnonymous":false,"name":"Michael Alisa","comment":"","address":"Salt Lake City, UT 84124, USA"},{"geo":{"lat":36.3033521,"lng":-119.3831026},"amt":50,"isAnonymous":true,"name":"Kyle Lasley","comment":"Dave, I&#039;m so sorry for the loss of your son","address":"Visalia, CA 93277, USA"},{"geo":{"lat":36.1036262,"lng":-114.939821},"amt":10,"isAnonymous":true,"name":"Kristin Cummings","comment":"","address":"Henderson, NV 89011, USA"},null,null,{"geo":{"lat":40.2120325,"lng":-111.6302998},"amt":10,"isAnonymous":false,"name":"Kate Reed","comment":"","address":"Provo, UT 84606, USA"},null,{"geo":{"lat":42.3376195,"lng":-122.7855028},"amt":250,"isAnonymous":false,"name":"Tanner Barratt","comment":"","address":"Medford, OR 97504, USA"},null,{"geo":{"lat":45.4395124,"lng":-122.7711943},"amt":100,"isAnonymous":false,"name":"Richard Grbavac","comment":"","address":"Portland, OR 97223, USA"},{"geo":{"lat":42.4909147,"lng":-123.0695586},"amt":50,"isAnonymous":false,"name":"Terry Haight","comment":"May God be with you and keep you.","address":"Gold Hill, OR 97525, USA"},{"geo":{"lat":40.9698029,"lng":-111.9164779},"amt":20,"isAnonymous":false,"name":"Joel  Cook","comment":"So sorry!","address":"Farmington, UT 84025, USA"},null,{"geo":{"lat":40.5623204,"lng":-111.9386203},"amt":50,"isAnonymous":false,"name":"Jonathan Ditto","comment":"","address":"South Jordan, UT 84095, USA"},{"geo":{"lat":39.9268916,"lng":-111.7376178},"amt":10,"isAnonymous":false,"name":"John Badali","comment":"I am so sorry for your loss '","address":"Payson, UT 84651, USA"},{"geo":{"lat":45.4395124,"lng":-122.7711943},"amt":20,"isAnonymous":false,"name":"Jessica Janakes","comment":"","address":"Portland, OR 97223, USA"},{"geo":{"lat":37.19633719999999,"lng":-113.5966577},"amt":5,"isAnonymous":false,"name":"Benjamin Martin","comment":"","address":"St George, UT 84770, USA"},{"geo":{"lat":40.6609843,"lng":-111.9164779},"amt":10,"isAnonymous":false,"name":"Mari Vellido","comment":"","address":"Salt Lake City, UT 84123, USA"},null,{"geo":{"lat":42.3376195,"lng":-122.7855028},"amt":20,"isAnonymous":false,"name":"Valerie Wright","comment":"So sorry for this tragic loss.","address":"Medford, OR 97504, USA"},null,null,null,null,{"geo":{"lat":29.5003744,"lng":-98.66555919999999},"amt":50,"isAnonymous":false,"name":"Amy Gastauer","comment":"","address":"San Antonio, TX 78250, USA"},{"geo":{"lat":40.2895017,"lng":-111.8807064},"amt":50,"isAnonymous":false,"name":"Josh Coffin","comment":"","address":"Saratoga Springs, UT 84045, USA"},{"geo":{"lat":29.9173682,"lng":-98.70407499999999},"amt":10,"isAnonymous":true,"name":"Hannah Stadler","comment":"I know that God is watching over you and your family, even when it seems like all hope is lost right now.
